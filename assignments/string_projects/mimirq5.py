#Given a string of any length, extract the numbers (digits) and print them on one line without spaces.

#Hint 1: start with an empty string

#Hint 2: isdigit() is your friend.

#For example, given this string:

#some 1! likes 2 put 14 digits, in 3 strings

#the output will be

#12143

s = input("Input a string: ")
b = ""
for index, letter in enumerate(s):
    if letter.isdigit() == True:
        b += letter
print(b)
